## transactionsAnalyzer.py
This program reads a CSV file of transaction records, inputting them into a list data structure.

Next, the user has two options in the main window: 
1. Displaying all transactions in sorted order (by date, name, or cost).
2. Display monthly spendings for a given year

Within the 1st option, the user could select a sort option that displays a listbox, which has the ability to filter out any name if the user pleases.

Within the 2nd option, the user can view a monthly graph for a given year. Options include the ability to show all transactions, filtered transactions, and specific transactions.

## Origin of the Project
While working at Trader Joe's, I wondered how much I was spending there.

Unfortunately, my credit card account doesn't allow the ability to analyze my transactions. (At least to my knowledge.) At best, I could scroll through the list of transactions and view each one individually. Nothing fancy.

That wasn't good enough for me; I wanted to organize my transactions in a way that I could view my spendings holistically.
For example, I wanted to see how much I've spend at Trader Joe's per month. Or because my parents used my credit card for the water and electric online bills, I wanted to exclude those transactions when viewing my personal spendings; don't worry, they reimbursed me.

Thus, this project is the result of my curiosity! 

P.S. Turns out I've spent a total of 1638.86 USD at Trader Joe's within a year range with my credit card. That averages to $137 per month. Not too shabby!
