### Origin of the Project

When I used to work at Trader Joe's, I wondered to myself how much I was spending there.
Unforunately, my credit card account doesn't allow the ability to analyze my transactions. (At least to my knowledge.) At best, I could scroll through the list of transactions and view each one individually. 
That wasn't good enough for me though. I wanted to organize my transactions in a way that I could understand my spendings.
For example, I wanted to see how much I've spend at Trader Joe's per month, or within a selected time range.
Thus, this project is the result of my curiosity! 

### Introduction to the Project

This program reads a CSV file of transaction records. 
The records are inputted into a data structure (Python's dictionary).
One option is displaying a list of the records in sorted order (by date, cost, or name).
The other option is selecting a year and displaying a graph of transactions pertaining to said year.
